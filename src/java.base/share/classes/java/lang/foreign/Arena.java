/**
 * An arena allocates and manages the lifecycle of native segments.
 * <p>
 * An arena is a {@linkplain AutoCloseable closeable} segment allocator that has a bounded {@linkplain MemorySession memory session}.
 * The arena's session starts when the arena is created, and ends when the arena is {@linkplain #close() closed}.
 * All native segments {@linkplain #allocate(long, long) allocated} by the arena are associated with its session, and
 * cannot be accessed after the arena is closed.
 * <p>
 * An arena is extremely useful when interacting with foreign code, as shown below:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * try (Arena arena = Arena.openConfined()) {
 *     MemorySegment nativeArray = arena.allocateArray(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
 *     MemorySegment nativeString = arena.allocateUtf8String("Hello!");
 *     MemorySegment upcallStub = linker.upcallStub(handle, desc, arena.session());
 *     ...
 * } // memory released here
 *}
 *
 * <h2 id = "thread-confinement">Safety and thread-confinement</h2>
 *
 * Arenas provide strong temporal safety guarantees: a memory segment allocated by an arena cannot be accessed
 * <em>after</em> the arena has been closed. The costs associated with maintaining this safety invariant can vary greatly,
 * depending on how many threads have access to the memory segments allocated by the arena. For instance, if an arena
 * is created and closed by one thread, and the segments associated with it are only ever accessed by that very same thread,
 * then ensuring correctness is simple.
 * <p>
 * Conversely, if an arena allocates segments that can be accessed by multiple threads, or if the arena can be closed
 * by a thread other than the accessing thread, the situation is much more complex. For instance, a segment might be accessed
 * <em>while</em> the associated arena is being closed, concurrently, by another thread. Even in this extreme case,
 * arenas must provide strong temporal safety guarantees, but doing so can incur in a higher performance impact.
 * For this reason, arenas can be divided into two categories: <em>thread-confined</em> arenas,
 * and <em>shared</em> arenas.
 * <p>
 * Confined arenas, support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an
 * {@linkplain #isOwnedBy(Thread) owner thread}, typically the thread which initiated the creation operation.
 * The segments created by a confined arena can only be {@linkplain MemorySession#isAccessibleBy(Thread) accessed}
 * by the thread that created the arena. Moreover, any attempt to close the confined arena from a thread other than the owner thread will
 * fail with {@link WrongThreadException}.
 * <p>
 * Shared memory sessions, on the other hand, have no owner thread. The segments created by a shared arena
 * can be {@linkplain MemorySession#isAccessibleBy(Thread) accessed} by multiple threads. This might be useful when
 * multiple threads need to access the same memory segment concurrently (e.g. in the case of parallel processing).
 * Moreover, a shared arena can be closed by any thread.
