/**
 * A thread-confined stack that can be reused by multiple clients to speed up allocation.
 * <p>
 * A stack contains a list of native memory segments {@code SS}, where each segment has size {@code B} - we
 * call this the stack's block size. The maximum number of segments in {@code SS} can be bounded by the
 * stack's <em>capacity</em> (if provided at construction). As the stack responds to allocation requests
 * (via an arena, see below), the contents of {@code SS} will be updated accordingly. A stack (and all the arenas
 * derived by it) can only be used by a single thread, the thread that created the stack.
 * <p>
 * Clients can allocate using the stack by calling its {@link #push()} method. This method returns a new
 * arena, which will be backed by the segments {@code SS} in the stack. An arena is said to be the
 * <em>topmost</em> arena if it is the latest arena to be returned by the {@link #push()} method.
 * Clients cannot interact with an arena obtained from a stack, unless it is the topmost arena.
 * When the topmost arena is {@link #close() closed} the memory allocated within it is returned to the stack, so that
 * it can be efficiently recycled. Closing the topmost arena might cause another, previously obtained arena,
 * to become the new topmost arena. When the stack itself is closed, the memory associated with the stack
 * (e.g. the memory segments in {@code SS}) will be released. A stack can be closed only if there's no
 * open topmost arena associated with it.
 * <p>
 * Let {@code I} be the index of the current segment being used by the topmost arena. The topmost arena responds to
 * allocation requests as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>if the size of the allocation requests is smaller than {@code B}, and {@code SS[I]} has a <em>free</em>
 *     slice {@code S} which fits that allocation request, return that {@code S};
 *     <li>if the size of the allocation requests is smaller than {@code B}, and {@code SS[I]} has no <em>free</em>
 *     slices which fits that allocation request, {@code I} is set to {@code I + 1}. Then, if {@code SS[I] == null},
 *     a new segment {@code S}, with size {@code B}, is allocated and added to {@code SS}. The arena then tries to respond
 *     to the same allocation request again;
 *     <li>if the size of the allocation requests is bigger than {@code B}, an {@link IllegalArgumentException}
 *     is thrown.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The topmost arena might throw an {@link OutOfMemoryError} if, during its use, the total memory allocated by all the
 * open arenas associated with the stack exceeds the system capacity, or whether {@code SS} exceeds the stack's capacity.
 * <p>
 * A stack can be useful when clients want to perform multiple allocation requests while avoiding the
 * cost associated with allocating a new off-heap memory region upon each allocation request:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * try (Stack stack = Stack.newStack()) {
 *     ...
 *     for (int i = 0 ; i < 1000 ; i++) {
 *         try (Arena localArena = stack.push()) {
 *             ...
 *             MemorySegment.allocateNative(100, localArena);
 *             ...
 *         } // arena memory recycled
 *     }
 *     ...
 *  } // arena memory released
 *}
 *
 * The above code creates a new stack. It then allocates memory in a loop; at each iteration,
 * a new topmost arena is obtained by calling the {@link #push()} method. When the topmost arena is closed,
 * the allocated memory is returned to the stack and then recycled on the subsequent iteration.
 * When the stack is closed, the off-heap memory associated with the stack is released.
