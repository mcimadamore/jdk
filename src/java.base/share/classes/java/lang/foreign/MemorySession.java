/**
 * A memory session models the lifetime of a memory segment.
 * <p>
 * Segments associated with a memory session can only be accessed while the session is {@linkplain #isAlive() alive}.
 * <p>
 * Memory sessions can be <em>unbounded</em> or <em>bounded</em>. An unbounded memory session is obtained by calling
 * {@link MemorySession#global()}. An unbounded memory session is always alive. As a result, the segments associated
 * with an unbounded session are always accessible and their backing regions of memory are never deallocated. Moreover,
 * memory segments associated with unbounded sessions can be {@linkplain #isAccessibleBy(Thread) accessed} from any thread.
 * <p>
 * Conversely, a bounded memory session has a start and an end. Bounded memory sessions can be managed either
 * explicitly, (i.e. using an {@linkplain Arena arena}) or implicitly, by the garbage collector. When a bounded memory
 * session ends, it is no longer {@linkplain #isAlive() alive}, and subsequent operations
 * on the segments associated with that bounded session (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#get(ValueLayout.OfInt, long)})
 * will fail with {@link IllegalStateException}. Moreover, to prevent temporal safety, access to memory segments associated with
 * bounded sessions might be <a href="Arena.html#thread-confinement">restricted to specific threads</a>.
 *
 * <h2 id="implicit">Implicitly-managed bounded memory sessions</h2>
 *
 * Managing bounded memory session explicitly, using arenas, while powerful, must be used with caution. An arena must always
 * be closed when no longer in use (this is done using {@link Arena#close()}). A failure to do so
 * might result in memory leaks. To mitigate this problem, clients can obtain an {@linkplain MemorySession#implicit() obtain}
 * bounded memory sessions that are managed implicitly, by the garbage collector. These sessions end at some unspecified
 * time <em>after</em> they become <a href="../../../java/lang/ref/package.html#reachability">unreachable</a>, as shown below:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(100, MemorySession.implicit());
 * ...
 * segment = null; // the session might end after this instruction
 *}
 *
 * Bounded sessions that are managed implicitly can be useful to manage long-lived segments, where timely deallocation
 * is not critical, or in unstructured cases where the boundaries of the lifetime associated with a memory session
 * cannot be easily determined. As shown in the example above, a memory session that is managed implicitly cannot end
 * if a program references to one or more segments associated with that session. This means that memory segments associated
 * with implicitly managed sessions can be safely {@linkplain #isAccessibleBy(Thread) accessed} from multiple threads.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * Implementations of this interface are thread-safe.
